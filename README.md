# One-Time-Pad-and-XOR-Cryptanalysis-Exercises
This repository contains Python implementations of core cryptographic operations including random key generation, byte-level XOR, ciphertext analysis, and crib-dragging techniques. The notebook explores weaknesses in reused one-time pad keys through hands-on problem solving and code demonstrations.
